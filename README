Machine Learning Tools

Purpose: to provide simple ML algorithm coding examples using Python and R

TODO:
- use R's mtcars data set to predict MPG given cyl and displ
  (now provided in 1D example, next, use in multivariate example)
- implement regularization
- automatically plot each X variable with y, along with fitted line
  in multivariate example (is this useful/possible?)
- contour plot of the cost function in 1D linear
- write plot routines in ggplot as well
- add logistic regression (classification) methods and examples
- add advanced linear regression methods
- organize regression/classification methods into different modules
- write mltools methods in R
