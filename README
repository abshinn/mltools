Machine Learning Tools

Purpose: to provide simple ML algorithm coding examples using Python and R

TODO:
- improve gradient descent fit in example 1
- use cross-validation in order to compute fit error
- organize regression/classification methods into different classes
- write plot routines in ggplot as well
- write mltools methods in R
