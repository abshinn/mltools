Machine Learning Tools

Purpose: to provide simple ML algorithm coding examples using Python and R

To do:
- clean up python example 1 scatter plot (clunky array conversions)
- write plot routines in ggplot
- use R's mtcars data set to predict MPG given cyl and displ
- contour plot of the cost function in 1D linear
- add logistic regression methods and example
- add advanced linear regression methods
- write mltools methods in R
