Machine Learning Tools

Purpose: to provide simple ML algorithm coding examples using Python and R

To do:
- use real data, perhaps from R's mtcars data set
- using python, create algorithm object
- automatic feature scaling for gradient decent
- multivariate gradient descent
- contour plot of the cost function in 1D linear
- normal method
