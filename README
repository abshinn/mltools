Machine Learning Tools

Purpose: to provide simple ML algorithm coding examples using Python and R

TODO:
- make sure regression is correct in mtcars examples
- add polynomial features to improve fit
- test regularizaton in normal equation
- implement regularization in gradient descent
- change ex1 to a logistic regression example, classifying cyl off of mpg and displ
- write plot routines in ggplot as well
- add advanced linear regression methods
- organize regression/classification methods into different modules
- write mltools methods in R
