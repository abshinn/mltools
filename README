Machine Learning Tools

Purpose: to provide simple ML algorithm coding examples using Python and R

TODO:
- un-normalize X in ex2 before plotting
- make sure ex2's plots are plotting what they should be plotting
- test regularizaton in normal equation
- implement regularization in gradient descent
- change ex1 to a logistic regression example, classifying cyl off of mpg and displ
- contour plot of the cost function in 1D linear
- write plot routines in ggplot as well
- add logistic regression (classification) methods and examples
- add advanced linear regression methods
- organize regression/classification methods into different modules
- write mltools methods in R
