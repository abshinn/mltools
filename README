Machine Learning Tools

Purpose: to provide simple ML algorithm coding examples using Python

TODO:
- improve gradient descent fit in example 1
- try to generalize plotting as much as possible, putting it in its own module
- implement cross validation
- implement SVM as a logistic regression counter-example
- write mltools methods in R
