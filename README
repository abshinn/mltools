Purpose: to provide simple ML algorithm coding examples using Python and R

TODO:
- add mtcars logistic regression example, classifying cyl off of mpg and displ
- test regularization in both descent and the normal equation
- write plot routines in ggplot as well
- add advanced linear regression methods
- organize regression/classification methods into different modules
- write mltools methods in R
