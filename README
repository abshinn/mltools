Machine Learning Tools

Purpose: to provide simple ML algorithm coding examples using Python and R

TODO:
- test regularizaton in normal equation
- implement regularization in gradient descent
- panel 1D example plots instead of having different plot windows
- contour plot of the cost function in 1D linear
- write plot routines in ggplot as well
- add logistic regression (classification) methods and examples
- add advanced linear regression methods
- organize regression/classification methods into different modules
- write mltools methods in R
